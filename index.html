      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        U.S. nominal GDP was $18.6 trillion in 2015. About 70% of U.S. GDP is
        personal consumption, with business investment 18%, government 17%
        (federal, state and local but excluding transfer payments such as Social
        Security, which is in consumption) and net exports a negative 3% due to
        the U.S. trade deficit. Real gross domestic product, a measure of both
        production and income, grew by 2.3% in 2017, vs. 1.5% in 2016 and 2.9%
        in 2015. Real GDP grew at a quarterly annualized rate of 2.2% in Q1
        2018, 4.2% in Q2 2018, 3.4% in Q3 2018 and 2.2% in Q4 2018 under
        President Trump; the Q2 rate was the best growth rate since Q3 2014, and
        the overall yearly GDP growth of 2.9% in 2018 was the best performance
        of the economy in a decade.
